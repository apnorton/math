C++ Directory
=============

I'm hoping to move towards a more competitive programming mode moving forward,
and this will necessitate a change to C++ instead of Java programming (at 
least for the vast majority of items).  Thus, I aim to rewrite much of my Java
libraries in C++, and then extend them to include graphs, matrices, etc.

Current contents:
  - Tests.cpp         : unit tests for the methods I've written
  - NumberTheory.cpp  : number theoretic things (primes, totient, etc)
  - Combinatorics.cpp : binomial coefficient, etc
